# CS336 Spring 2025 Assignment 1: Basics - Dmitry's Solution

This is my take on the assignment 1 of the Spring 2025 version of Stanford's [CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/).  
It is an amazing 50-page assignment, which I very much enjoyed doing!  Read my [writeup](./writeup.pdf) together with [the assignment handout](./cs336_spring2025_assignment1_basics.pdf).

Below is the original README...

For a full description of the assignment, see the assignment handout at
[cs336_spring2025_assignment1_basics.pdf](./cs336_spring2025_assignment1_basics.pdf)

If you see any issues with the assignment handout or code, please feel free to
raise a GitHub issue or open a pull request with a fix.

## Setup

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).
